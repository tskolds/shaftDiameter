# shaftDiameter.m
### MATLAB script to solve shaft section diameters using iteration based on an initial guess.

Script asks for inputs of variables needed in the diameter equation. A while loop is used to iterate
on the equation until the result converges. Opportunity is given to change stress concentration factors
after the first iteration. 

Originally created to use for homework in MECH325 @ CSU, however this could be useful down the line.
